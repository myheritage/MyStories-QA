# SLOW_MO: Slows down Playwright operations by the specified number of milliseconds
# - 0: No delay (default, good for CI/CD)

# Test Data
# DEFAULT_TIMEOUT: Maximum time (in milliseconds) to wait for any operation
# - Used for page loads, navigations, and long-running operations
# - Should be higher than EXPECT_TIMEOUT
# - Default: 30000 (30 seconds)
# - Increase for slower connections or complex operations
# - Note: Playwright's global timeout is set to 120000 (2 minutes) in playwright.config.ts
DEFAULT_TIMEOUT=30000

# EXPECT_TIMEOUT: Maximum time (in milliseconds) to wait for expect() assertions
# - Used for element visibility, text content, and other assertions
# - Should be lower than DEFAULT_TIMEOUT
# - Default: 5000 (5 seconds)
# - Increase if UI updates are slower
# - Typically should be enough for most UI interactions
EXPECT_TIMEOUT=5000
